  # Manual trigger: Allows re-running the workflow for an existing tag
  # Use case: If the automatic release build fails due to transient errors
  # (e.g., GitHub infrastructure issues), you can manually retry without
  # needing to delete and recreate the release.
  #
  # To use:
  # 1. Go to Actions → "Publish Container Image" → "Run workflow"
  # 2. In "Use workflow from" dropdown: select the TAG as the ref you want to rebuild
  # 3. Check "Also push as latest tag" if this is a stable release and not a pre-release
  # 4. Click "Run workflow"

      # NOTE: the resulting image is tagged as follows:
      # 1. [ALWAYS] Semantic version tag:
      #    - extracts version from github.ref (must be a git tag ref)
      #
      # 2. [CONDITIONAL] 'latest' tag to ensure latest points to stable releases only:
      #    - release event: only for stable releases, i.e. '!github.event.release.prerelease'
      #    - manual workflow trigger: only if 'push_latest' checkbox is checked
