Hermeto is a CLI tool that pre-fetches your project's dependencies to aid in
making your build process [hermetic][].

To see if we support your package manager(s), please check the
[package managers](#package-managers) section.

The primary intended use of Hermeto's outputs is for network-isolated container
builds.

## Goals

Please note that Hermeto is rather picky, aiming to

- encourage or enforce best practices
- never execute arbitrary code [^pip-download-example]
- keep the implementation simple

To play nicely with Hermeto, the build process for your project must be

- **Defined** - Hermeto only fetches dependencies that are explicitly declared -
  typically in a lockfile generated by your package manager.
- **Reproducible** - Hermeto will refuse to fetch a dependency if it's not
  pinned to an exact version. This goes for transitive dependencies as well (and
  ties to the Defined point). Most package managers pin all dependencies
  automatically in lockfiles.
- **Secure** - Even with a lockfile, your build is not truly safe from supply
  chain attacks unless you verify the checksums of all dependencies. If your
  package manager supports specifying the expected checksums, we strongly
  encourage you to make use of them.

  ⚠ Hermeto will verify checksums if present, but doesn't require them by
  default. This may change in the future.

In return, Hermeto will help make your build

- **Auditable** - by generating a manifest of all the dependencies that go into
  your build.

The ability to achieve the goals depends on the build process being *hermetic*.
Ideally, you should try to isolate the build from both the internet and the
underlying host system to avoid implicit dependencies, unreproducible behavior
and whole hosts of other issues. Hermeto itself is not a hermetic build system.
We suggest you take advantage of existing technologies - such as containers - to
achieve network isolation.

## Installation

### Standalone

We do not distribute Hermeto as a standalone package as of now.

To install Hermeto for local development, see CONTRIBUTING.md.

### Container image

<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line link-image-style -->
[![container badge]][hermeto container status]

```text
quay.io/konflux-ci/hermeto:latest
```

The container is re-built automatically on every merge to the main branch.

You may wish to set up an alias to make local usage more convenient

```shell
alias hermeto='podman run --rm -ti -v "$PWD:$PWD:z" -w "$PWD" quay.io/konflux-ci/hermeto:latest'
```

Note that the alias mounts the current working directory — the container will
have access to files in that directory and nowhere else.

## Basic usage

```shell
hermeto fetch-deps \
  --source ./my-repo \
  --output ./hermeto-output \
  --sbom-output-type cyclonedx \
  gomod
```

The `fetch-deps` command fetches your project's dependencies and stores them on
your disk. Hermeto also produces a detailed SBOM containing information about
all the project's components and packages. You can find the SBOM in the output
directory.

See `docs/usage.md` for a more detailed, practical example of Hermeto usage.

You might also like to check out `hermeto --help` and the `--help` texts of the
available subcommands.

## Configuration

### Modes

Hermeto can be run in two modes using the global CLI option `--mode`.

- strict
- permissive

The default mode is `strict`. In this mode, *some* input requirements that are
not met are treated as errors. On the other hand, the `permissive` mode treats
them as warnings. This means that Hermeto will proceed and generate an SBOM, but
it may not be complete or accurate.

The permissive mode can currently suppress the following:

- go `vendor` directory inconsistencies (See `docs/gomod.md` on vendoring
  information)

### Available configuration parameters

You can change Hermeto's configuration by specifying a configuration file while
invoking any of the CLI commands

```shell
hermeto --config-file config.yaml fetch-deps --source ./my-repo gomod
```

Any parameter specified in this file will override the default values present in
the [config.py][] module.

The only supported format for the config file is YAML.

- `default_environment_variables` a dictionary where the keys are names of
  package managers. The values are dictionaries where the keys are default
  environment variables to set for that package manager and the values are the
  environment variable values.
- `gomod_download_max_tries` a maximum number of attempts for retrying go
  commands.
- `gomod_strict_vendor` (deprecated: *This option no longer has any effect
  when set*) the bool to disable/enable the strict vendor mode. For a repo that
  has gomod dependencies, if the `vendor` directory exists and this config
  option is set to `True`, one of the vendoring flags must be used.
- `goproxy_url` sets the value of the GOPROXY variable that Hermeto uses
  internally when downloading Go modules. See [Go environment variables][].
- `requests_timeout` a number (in seconds) for `requests.get()`'s 'timeout'
  parameter, which sets an upper limit on how long `requests` can take to make a
  connection and/or send a response. Larger numbers set longer timeouts.
- `subprocess_timeout` a number (in seconds) to set a timeout for commands
  executed by the `subprocess` module. Set a larger number to give the
  subprocess execution more time.

**†** Currently, **rpm** is not fully supported. Therefore, we do not have
documentation for it.

### [bundler][]

Hermeto supports bundler by parsing the [Gemfile.lock][] file present in the
source repository and downloading the declared dependencies.

To generate a lockfile or to make sure the file is up to date, you can use for
example the `bundle lock` command, which generates the `Gemfile.lock` file based
on the dependencies specified in the [Gemfile][]. Both files must be present in
the source repository so you should check them into your git repository.

See docs/bundler.md for more details.

### [cargo][]

Hermeto supports Cargo by invoking the Cargo CLI to fetch Rust dependencies as
declared in your project, ensuring reproducible builds with explicitly defined
versions. Make sure to have up-to-date [Cargo.lock][] present in your project.

See docs/cargo.md for more details.

### generic fetcher

Generic fetcher is a way for Hermeto to support prefetching arbitrary files that
don't fit into other package managers. With the generic fetcher, you can easily
fetch those files with Hermeto along with your other language-specific
dependencies, satisfy the hermetic build condition and have them recorded in the
SBOM.

Hermeto uses a simple custom lockfile named `artifacts.lock.yaml` that is
expected to be present in the repository, or supplied in JSON input. The
lockfile describes the urls, checksums and output filenames for the downloaded
files.

Currently supported types of artifacts

- Arbitrary files
- Maven artifacts

See docs/generic.md for more details.

### [gomod][]

Current version: 1.24 [^2] [^3]

The gomod package manager works by parsing the [go.mod][] file present in the
source repository to determine which dependencies to download. Hermeto does not
parse this file on its own - rather, we rely on the `go` command to download and
list the required dependencies.

From Go 1.17 onward, the go.mod file includes all the transitively required
dependencies of your application - see the section about *Pruned module graphs*
in the [Go 1.17 changelog][]. In previous Go versions, the go.mod file included
only direct dependencies. Hermeto does support downloading and listing all
transitive dependencies for earlier versions thanks to Go's backwards
compatibility[^3]. Note that using Go >= 1.17 in your project has the
added benefit of downloading fewer dependencies (as noted in the changelog), in
some cases drastically so.

See docs/gomod.md for more details.

### [npm][]

Hermeto supports npm by parsing [package-lock.json][] file present in the source
repository and downloading the declared dependencies.

To generate lockfile or to make sure the file is up to date, you can use
[npm install][].

Make sure lockfile version is higher than v1 (Node.js 15 or higher).

See docs/npm.md for more details.

### [pip][]

Hermeto supports pip by parsing [requirements.txt][] files present in the source
repository and downloading the declared dependencies.

The files must be lockfiles, i.e. declare all the transitive dependencies and
pin them to specific versions. Generating such a lockfile is best done using
tools like [pip-compile][]

We support source distribution file format ([sdist][]) as well as binary
distribution file format ([wheel][]).

See docs/pip.md for more details.

### [yarn][]

Current version: v4

Unlike NPM, hermeto merely drives the underlying `yarn` CLI command operations,
that is, hermeto leaves most of the heavy lifting to Yarn itself and it mainly
focuses on post-process validation. Note that having a Yarn lockfile
(`yarn.lock`) checked into the repository is paramount for hermeto to process a
project successfully. If missing, you can easily generate one by running
[yarn install][] prior to pointing hermeto to your project.

See docs/yarn.md for more details.

## Project status

Hermeto was derived from (but is not a direct fork of) [Cachito][].

[^pip-download-example]: See for example this [python.org discussion][]

[^2]: Hermeto expects to use a specific version of the `go` command
  when downloading dependencies. This is the version installed in the
  [hermeto container](#container-image). We do not guarantee correctness if you
  run Hermeto locally (outside the container) with a different Go version.
  You *are* free to use a different version to build your project.

[^3]: The `go` command promises to be backwards compatible with previous
  versions. If your go.mod file specifies the intended go version, Hermeto
  should handle it appropriately. If your go version is *higher* than what
  Hermeto uses, there is a good chance it will be compatible regardless, as long
  as the dependency resolution did not change between the two versions.
  For example, dependency resolution did change in [Go 1.18][] but not in
  [Go 1.19][]. Things are a bit more complicated with [Go 1.21][], if you are or
  have been experiencing issues with hermeto related to Go 1.21+, please refer
  to our gomod documentation for more details.
